What is it?
-----------

daniel is a fast password generator based on using a single master password.
When generating a password, it produces a small "reminder" containing all the
information necessary to reproduce the password, but only in conjunction with
the master password.  Without the master password, the reminder is useless.

How does it work?
-----------------

Simply run the script from the command line:

-----
% daniel
Please enter your master password:
-----

Enter a strong master password.  This can actually be a passphrase: it can
contain any text you like, as long as it's in UTF-8.  Be sure this is something
you can remember, since your passwords cannot be recovered if you forget it.

Then daniel will print out a six-character checksum.  This checksum is computed
based on the master password, and it will likely be different if you
accidentally mistype your master password.  This helps prevent you from
generating a lot of passwords based on a mistyped passphrase and then being
unable to reproduce them.

daniel then prompts you for a code.  This code is used to generate a unique
password.  One common technique is to use an abbreviated form of the domain
name, so if you wanted to generate a password for GitHub, you could use
"github.com" (without the quotes).

Finally, daniel produces the password and a reminder.  If you run daniel with
the reminder on the command line, it will print out the same password as before
once you enter your master password.

-----
% ./daniel
Please enter your master password:
# ok, checksum is 72eb36
Enter code: example.tld
Password is: nj&xzO@hz&QvuoGY
Reminder is: 72eb360a1000example.tld

% ./daniel 72eb360a1000example.tld
Please enter your master password:
# ok, checksum is 72eb36
Password is: nj&xzO@hz&QvuoGY
-----

The master password in this case was "foobar".  Please use something more
secure.

Can I adjust the set of characters that are generated?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes.  The flags parameter can be adjusted on the command line with -f, or by
entering +!flags=_<value>_+ at the "Enter code:" prompt.  When the flags are set
to 0, all characters from hex 20 to hex 7E are included.  The different bits
mean:

|=====
|Flag |Meaning
|1    |Exclude all digits
|2    |Exclude spaces
|4    |Exclude those characters on top of the digits on a US keyboard
|8    |Exclude other symbols
|16   |Exclude letters
|=====

The default is 10 (exclude spaces and other symbols) because many websites don't
want to accept those characters.  The flags parameter is encoded as part of the
reminder, and changing the flags will cause a completely different password to
be generated.

Can I adjust the length of the password?
----------------------------------------

Yes.  The length can be adjusted using the -l parameter, or by entering
+!length=_<value>_+ at the "Enter code:" prompt.  The length is encoded as part
of the reminder, but it does not cause the generated password to be any
different other than in length.  That is, truncating a 16-character password to
8 characters is exactly the same as generating an 8-character password with the
same parameters.  The default length is 16.

What if a site forces me to change my password frequently?
----------------------------------------------------------

There is a version field that can be incremented to produce a completely
different password.  Use -v or enter +!version=_<value>_+ at the "Enter code:"
prompt.  The default version is 0, and values up to 127 are accepted.  The
version is encoded as part of the reminder.

This feature was written with the corporate and academic worlds in mind, but it
can also be used if you absolutely need one of a certain set of characters in
your password, but the default one that was generated does not contain such a
character.  Simply bump the version number until a satisfactory password is
generated.

Can I use this to remember a password I generated with a different program?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.  You can use the -m flag to put daniel into existing password mode.
Instead of generating a new password, it will prompt you (twice) for an existing
password, and generate a reminder from that.  These reminders are much longer
than the standard kind, however.

You _must not_ use the same code for regular mode and existing password mode, as
this is insecure and can leak your password.

Can I copy the password to the clipboard instead of printing it?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.  Install the clipboard gem and its dependencies and use the +-p+ option.
Note that on Linux, the xclip utility is required unless you are using a version
of the clipboard gem newer than 1.0.5, as xsel support is broken in earlier
versions.

What characters are above the digits on a US keyboard?
------------------------------------------------------

The following: '!@#$%^&*()'.

Why isn't this a gem?
---------------------

daniel _can_ be loaded with Kernel#load, or with Kernel#require if you use the
version in the lib directory (since it has an '.rb' extension).  The tests use
this technique.

It's also designed to be a single, standalone script so that people can copy it
wherever they might need it.

Why is daniel written in Ruby?
------------------------------

Ruby provides all the necessary cryptographic primitives as part of the standard
library.  Other languages, such as Perl, do not.

What versions of Ruby are supported?
------------------------------------

The code should run on MRI 1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, and 2.1._x_.  1.8 will require
the io-console gem for interactive use; this is part of the standard library in
1.9.3.

At least some versions of JRuby are missing the appropriate classes for SHA-256,
and the jruby-openssl gem will probably be required.  However, at least in
theory, there's no reason it shouldn't function just fine on JRuby and Rubinius
as well.

Having said that, only MRI 1.9.3, 2.0.0, and 2.1._x_ are officially supported.
I will probably notice if the tests fail on 1.8.7 and fix it myself. Please feel
free to send a pull request if it doesn't work on your preferred flavor
(although please stick to 1.8.7-equivalent or newer).

So what about the cryptography you're using?
--------------------------------------------

Glad you asked.  Essentially, the master password is hashed with some static
data using 1024 iterations of PBKDF-2 using HMAC-SHA256.  No salt is used, since
there is no place to store the salt.  This produces the master secret.  The
code, flags, password version, and some static data are hashed using PBKDF-2
again, this time with the master secret as the salt.  This produces the
initialization vector.

To generate the password, AES-256 in counter mode is used as a byte generator,
with the master secret as the key and the first 16 bytes of the initialization
vector, as, well, the initialization vector.  If a generated byte is in the set
of acceptable values, it is output; otherwise, it is discarded.

For existing password mode, the byte generator is run the same way, except that
the first _n_ bytes (where _n_ is the existing password length), regardless of
value, are XORed with the existing password to generate a mask, which is encoded
in the reminder.

The checksum is generated from the first three bytes, hex-encoded, of the
SHA-256 hash of the master secret and some static data.  This is done from the
master secret and not the master password because it forces an attacker to go
through the PBKDF-2 step in order to generate candidate matches.

That's it.  The algorithm was designed to be difficult to attack, and yet fast
enough to run on a low-powered Android phone.
