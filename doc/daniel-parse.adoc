daniel-parse(1)
===============

Name
----
daniel-parse - parser for daniel(1) reminders

Synopsis
--------
[verse]
'daniel-parse' [--prompt] [-r] <pattern> <file>

Description
-----------
daniel-parse parses a file containing daniel(1) reminders and outputs those with
codes that match the given pattern (a Perl-compatible regular expression).

Since daniel(1) can produce anonymous reminders, it is possible to have a file
containing various reminders without being able to easily determine what codes
they refer to (as the actual data may be Base64-encoded).  daniel-parse allows
easier maintenance of such reminder files.

Options
-------
-r::
	Produce machine-readable output.  All generated data (including passwords)
	will be URI-encoded.

--prompt::
  Prompt for a passphrase.  Only reminders which match this passphrase will be
  emitted.  Note that for version 0 reminders, only a comparison of checksums is
  done, as no further integrity checking can be provided.
