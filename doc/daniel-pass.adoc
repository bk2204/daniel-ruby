Name
----
daniel-pass - password generator for throwaway passwords

Synopsis
--------
[verse]
'daniel-pass' [-p] <code>

Description
-----------
daniel-pass produces unique throwaway passwords based on a low-value secret and
a code which identifies the particular password.  This tool is designed for
situations such as testing or quality assurance work which require many
low-value passwords that pass typical password tests.

This tool is not suitable for strong passwords used for real authentication, as
it relies on a secret written in plaintext on disk.  If you need strong
passwords for authentication, please use daniel(1) instead.

The code, which must be provided on the command line, is typically a username,
hostname, or email address, but can be any valid UTF-8 string.

Options
-------
-p::
	Print the password to standard output without a trailing newline.  The default
	if this option is not specified is to copy the password to the clipboard.
	Note that this option has the inverse meaning of the `-p` flag for daniel(1).

-r::
	Produce machine-readable output.  All generated data (including passwords)
	will be URI-encoded.

-v <version>::
	Specify a particular password version.  The default is 0.  This can be useful
	for testing situations that require password changes.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration is read from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/daniel/main.yaml`.  The file is
a YAML file containing a top-level key `presets`, and under that a key
`throwaway`.  The `flags`, `version`, `length`, `salt`, `iterations`,
`format-version`, and `passphrase` keys are read from the throwaway section and
used to set the corresponding parameters.  The `passphrase` key is mandatory;
all other values default to the standard daniel(1) defaults.
